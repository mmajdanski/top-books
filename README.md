# Hi There!

This project was made in order to create a Amazon Top 100 Book List. To simplify the project, it only uses the Top 20 List from Amazon (since the idea is pretty much the same for the other 80 books, you would just need to change the HTML scraping that is happening).

**Note**: The App is getting its data directly from Amazon. None of the data is being stored locally (in a JSON file or localhost) or via a Database

Visit [https://amazon-top-books.vercel.app/](https://amazon-top-books.vercel.app/) for the Live App!
